# ML-Toolbox
It is a compact user-friendly machine learning interface for everybody. Common machine learning techniques are included in this toolbox. Exploratory data analysis can be implemented before applying techniques. Reports of the analysis are available to download.

# Techniques to be covered

### Regression
- Linear Regression 
- Generalized Linear Regression: logistic, poisson, negative binomial
- ANOVA
- K-NN
- Trees: Random Forest, Boosting
- SVM
- Neural Network
- GAM

### Classification
- K-NN
- Trees

## Unsupervise Learning
- K-Mean
